"""Reverse enroll-stash — the gatekeeper side of live-voice enrolment (#376).

The mirror of `uid_stash.py`. There, the gatekeeper writes `{transcript -> uid}`
for the engine to read; here, the engine writes an `enroll_requests` row for a
candidate uid and the gatekeeper reads it, captures the speaker's PCM across the
onboarding turns, and writes the enrolment result back.

When the gatekeeper is HA's Wyoming STT provider it already holds each turn's PCM
(16 kHz mono int16) — the same format `/enrol` wants — and the enrol store is
in-process (`embeddings_store.upsert_embedding`), so no HTTP round-trip is
needed. Per onboarding turn the handler claims the pending row, embeds this
turn's audio as one sample, and once the target count is reached enrols the
averaged embedding and flips the row to `done` (or `failed` with a reason).

Consume-once + a short TTL bound the misattribution risk (same as the uid
stash): the request only captures the speaker for a brief window after the engine
opens it, so a later unrelated turn can't enrol into someone else's profile, and
a request no gatekeeper picks up (speaker-ID off) ages out so the engine side can
time out honestly rather than hang.

Sync sqlite3 over the same `solilos.db`; the table is provisioned by alembic
migration `0014_enroll_requests`. A missing table/DB makes every op a no-op so
the STT path keeps working when the init container hasn't migrated yet.
