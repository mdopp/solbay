"""Per-turn reasoning-effort selection for voice turns (#222).

Measured on the box: a household tool turn ("welche Lichter sind an") spent
~90% of its 12-15s budget generating a reasoning block that the operator never
sees. `reasoning_effort: "none"` over Hermes' /v1 cuts the SAME tool call to
~1.35s (`extra_body.think=False` had no effect — `reasoning_effort` is the
working knob). Voice is household *control*; almost every turn is a tool action
that wants the fast path.

So the default is `"none"` (fast) for everything. We escalate to real reasoning
only on a strong, explicit signal: the resident asks for it in words ("denk
nach", "erkläre genau", "think it through", …). Keep this list short and
obvious — this is a deliberately conservative cue match, NOT a complexity
classifier (a fragile classifier would misroute the common control turns into
the slow path, which is exactly the pain we are fixing).
