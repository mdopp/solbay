"""SQLite-backed storage for Solilos voice embeddings (#937 Phase 2).

The `voice_embeddings` table is provisioned by the baseline Alembic
migration (`schema/migrations/versions/20260516_0001_baseline.py`):
one row per resident `uid`, BLOB embedding (256 × float32 = 1024 B),
`sample_count` averaged over enrolment, and `enrolled_via`.

This module owns the read/write contract; the resolver in
`speaker.py` calls into it for the k-NN sweep, and the enrolment
endpoint calls into it to upsert a freshly-averaged embedding.

Design notes:

  * Sync sqlite3. The store is called from async handlers, but each
    op is millisecond-cheap (read 3–10 rows, write one row).
    Wrapping it in `asyncio.to_thread` was considered and dropped;
    the simplicity of sync I/O wins until enrolment rows reach the
    hundreds, which they never will in a household setting.
  * Embeddings on disk are little-endian float32. `numpy.tobytes()`
    produces that on every architecture we target.
  * If solilos.db does not yet exist (gatekeeper booted before the
    init container has run), `list_embeddings` returns `[]` and
    upsert raises. Callers downgrade to default_uid in that case.
