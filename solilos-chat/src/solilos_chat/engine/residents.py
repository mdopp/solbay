"""Resident identity for a personal turn (#352).

When the live voice path attributes a turn to an enrolled resident (the
gatekeeper's ECAPA+kNN resolves the speaker and stashes {transcript -> uid},
#350), the turn's uid is that resident's id instead of the shared household
uid. This module turns that uid into a system block that tells the model WHO
is speaking, so answers can address the person.

A turn is personal only when its uid is a real resident: a non-empty uid that
is neither the configured `default_uid` (the shared household identity, also
HA's fallback `user`) nor the ephemeral `guest`/`default` sentinels. For those
the block is empty and the prompt is byte-identical to before — the household
hot path (uid=household, the only live path while speaker-ID ships dormant)
sees no personalization and no prefix-cache churn.

Per-resident preferences/facts are NOT stored yet (no resident-profile store
exists). The seam is `_prefs(uid)`: it returns an empty list today, and a
future store reads here without touching the call sites.
"""
