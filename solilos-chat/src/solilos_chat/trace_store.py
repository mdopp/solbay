"""SQLite access to persisted per-message LLM traces.

Reads/writes the `session_traces` table (migration 0007) in solilos.db. Phase 2
of the trace sidecar (#306): at turn time the server pulls the trace proxy's
Ollama calls for that turn's window, assigns them a stable per-message
`trace_id`, and persists each step here in order — so reopening a chat shows the
same trace, persistently. `detail_id` links a step back to the proxy's
`/__traces__/<id>` exact-content record.

Sync sqlite3, like `topics_store` / `mentions_store`: each op is
millisecond-cheap. If solilos.db or the table is missing (the schema-init
sidecar hasn't migrated yet), writes/reads degrade to no-op/empty rather than
erroring — the trace panel just shows nothing until the migration lands.

Scoping is per-resident (D3): every row carries the recording `owner_uid` and
every read/write is filtered by it, so a resident never sees another resident's
trace.
