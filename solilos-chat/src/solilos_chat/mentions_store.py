"""SQLite access to inline `#tag` / `@person` mentions.

Reads/writes the `mentions` table (migration 0006) in solilos.db. The proxy
parses `#tag` and `@person` tokens out of each user turn and records them here,
scoped to the resident (#279, solilos-architecture.md §3). The tag-cloud reads a
session's mentions; the autosuggest endpoints read a resident's known tags /
persons.

Sync sqlite3, like `topics_store` / the gatekeeper's `rooms_store`: each op is
millisecond-cheap. If solilos.db or the table is missing (the schema-init
sidecar hasn't migrated yet), reads degrade to empty rather than erroring — the
cloud/autosuggest just show nothing until the migration lands.

Scoping is per-resident (D3): every row carries the recording `owner_uid` and
every read/write is filtered by it, so a resident never sees another resident's
mentions.
