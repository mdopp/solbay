"""SQLite access to the topics registry and chat<->topic assignments.

Reads the `topics` table (registry, migration 0004) and reads/writes
`session_topics` (chat<->topic assignment, migration 0005) in solilos.db. The
proxy is otherwise stateless; this is the one store it owns for the Topics
feature (the assignment + display surfaces, #241).

Sync sqlite3, like the gatekeeper's `rooms_store`: each op is millisecond-cheap.
If solilos.db or a table is missing (the schema-init sidecar hasn't migrated
yet), reads degrade to empty rather than erroring — the picker just shows no
topics until the migration lands.

Scoping is per-resident (D3): assignments carry the assigning `owner_uid` and
every read/write is filtered by it, so a resident never sees or mutates another
resident's chat<->topic rows.
