"""Engine side of the reverse enroll-stash for live-voice onboarding (#376).

The mirror of `voice_uid_stash.py`: there the gatekeeper writes and the engine
reads; here the engine *opens* an `enroll_requests` row for a candidate uid and
the gatekeeper — when it is HA's Wyoming STT provider — captures the speaker's
PCM across the onboarding turns and writes the enrolment result back. This module
opens the request and reads the result; the gatekeeper-side writer is
`gatekeeper/enroll_stash.py`.

The biometric audio never reaches this table — only the candidate uid, a sample
target/count, and the gatekeeper's terminal status. `created_at` bounds a TTL so
a request no gatekeeper picks up (speaker-ID off) times out honestly instead of
leaving the dialog hanging.

Sync sqlite3, like `pending_residents_store`. The table is provisioned by
migration `0014_enroll_requests`; a missing table/DB raises on open (so the tool
surfaces the failure) and reads as a non-terminal status (so the dialog can fall
through to its timeout).
