"""SQLite access to pending resident-registration requests.

Reads/writes the `pending_residents` table (migration 0013) in solilos.db. The
onboarding registration flow (#376) writes a row here after the gatekeeper has
enrolled a guest's voice; the admin-approval step (#355, separate) reads the
pending rows and flips their status. A pending row is **not** an account — it is
only the local record of a request awaiting approval.

Sync sqlite3, like `topics_store` / `mentions_store`: each op is millisecond-
cheap. If solilos.db or the table is missing (the schema-init sidecar hasn't
migrated yet), a read degrades to empty and a write raises so the registration
tool can surface the failure rather than silently dropping the request.

Not per-resident scoped: a candidate has no resident uid of their own yet (only
the one they're asking for), so a pending request belongs to the household. The
biometric audio never reaches this table — only the candidate uid/name and
whether enrolment succeeded.
