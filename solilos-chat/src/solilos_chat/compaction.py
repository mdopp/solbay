"""Chat compaction: extract durable learnings, then compact (#210).

A long chat grows past the model's context window and buries durable knowledge
in transcript. Compaction frees the window *without* losing what matters, in a
strict order: **extract first, compact second** — so nothing durable is dropped
even if the later step fails.

Two triggers feed the same backend:
  - **Hard cap** — a turn finds the session's running token usage near the
    context-window cap; we compact before the next turn so it never truncates
    mid-conversation (wired in `server.py`).
  - **Overnight cron** — a Hermes job (the `chat-compactor` skill, registered in
    `solbay`'s post-deploy) compacts stale chats unattended.

Hermes-capability facts this design is built on (read from the Hermes source +
our client, NOT box-verified here — see the verify checklist in the unit notes):

  1. **Per-session token usage is measurable.** Hermes' single-session fetch
     (`GET /api/sessions/{id}`) carries `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` running
     totals (`hermes._session_summary` already surfaces them). `usage_fraction`
     reads those against the configured context window — so the hard-cap trigger
     has a real signal. (ASSUMPTION to box-verify: that these totals are the
     prompt-token running total, not just the last turn.)

  2. **There is NO in-place history truncate/replace API.** `create_session`
     accepts a `system_prompt` only at create time; `PATCH` sets only the title;
     there is no endpoint to drop or rewrite a session's messages. So compaction
     v1 is **continuation, not in-place rewrite**: we summarise the old session
     and open a *fresh* session seeded with `{summary + a pointer to the extracted
     learnings}` as its system prompt. The original session is **kept** (never
     deleted) — the transcript stays as the durable record; the resident simply
     continues in the small-context continuation.

  3. **Durable learnings go through the active memory provider's tools, not an
     HTTP store.** The holographic provider exposes `fact_store`/`fact_feedback`
     as *agent* tools (the model calls them mid-turn); there is no proxy-callable
     memory endpoint. So the extraction pass is itself an LLM turn whose prompt
     instructs the agent to call `fact_store` for each durable learning. That
     reuses the existing memory mechanism — we invent no new store.

So both passes (extract, summarise) are ordinary Hermes chat turns on the
*source* session, run before the continuation is opened.
