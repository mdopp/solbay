"""Facade-side reader for the transcript-keyed uid side-channel (#350).

The gatekeeper, acting as HA's Wyoming STT provider, resolves the speaking
resident and writes `{transcript -> uid}` into `solilos.db.voice_uid_stash`
(see `gatekeeper/uid_stash.py`). HA then calls the engine facade
(`conversation.sol`) with the same transcript as the latest user message but
no uid. This module looks the uid up by that transcript so the spoken turn
is attributed to the right resident.

Consume-once + short TTL: a lookup deletes the row (so a later turn with the
same utterance never re-reads a stale identity) and ignores rows older than
the TTL (so a transcript that never reached the facade — e.g. HA dropped the
turn — can't attribute a much-later identical utterance). On any miss the
caller falls back to `household`.
