# Hermes — template changelog

## Unreleased — #230

The post-deploy now writes `agent.disabled_toolsets` into `config.yaml` to
shrink the cold-cache prefill latency floor. Hermes enables ~15 built-in
toolsets for every session by default; their cumulative tool-definition
schemas — not, as first suspected, an inlined Home Assistant entity-state
dump — are the dominant chunk of the ~29k-token system prompt (the
`homeassistant` toolset only registers `ha_list_entities` / `ha_get_state` /
`ha_list_services` / `ha_call_service` and fetches state lazily, and the
state-pushing HA *gateway* is `watch_*`-gated and off by default). We
blacklist four toolsets the household assistant never uses — `browser`
(engine already `disabled`), `code_execution` (`dynamic-skills` forbids
running generated code), `image_gen` (we ingest images via vision, never
generate), and `delegation` (no multi-agent path) — so their schemas (and
associated prompt guidance) drop out of every prefill. Capabilities the
household relies on are kept: `homeassistant`, `skills`, `memory`, `web`,
`vision`, `tts`, `todo`, `file` + `terminal` (skills write notes and ripgrep
the vault through these), `cronjob`, `session_search`. No schema-version
bump — config.yaml is rewritten on every deploy, so there is no migration.

No knob exists to disable a (nonexistent) HA state dump; further prompt
shrink beyond toolset trimming (the built-in default system prompt itself,
per-tool schema verbosity) is Hermes-internal — an upstream/Hermes-config ask.

## v3 — #940

Solilos's dynamic skill compiler now drafts pending skills into a separate
host directory that Hermes' loader does not scan. The Hermes pod gets a
new bind mount, `{{DATA_DIR}}/solbay/skills-pending` at
`/opt/data/skills-pending`, alongside the existing
`/opt/data/skills/solilos` mount.

Operator impact: none on redeploy. The host directory is auto-created
(`type: DirectoryOrCreate`) and starts empty. The ServiceBay dashboard
gains a "Pending Solilos skills" panel under **Settings → Integrations**
where the admin promotes or rejects drafts before they go live.

Before v3 the Solilos `dynamic-skills` skill instructed Hermes to write
new skills directly under `/opt/data/skills/solilos/...` and to call
`restart_service hermes`, which auto-activated agent-generated code
with no human review — a prompt-injection risk. v3 retires that path.

## v2 — #829

The Hermes web dashboard is now exposed as a real service.

Before v2 the dashboard was nominally opt-in via `HERMES_DASHBOARD_PORT`
and a set of `HERMES_DASHBOARD*` env vars — but `hermes gateway run`
never reads those env vars, so the dashboard never actually started. It
also had no subdomain, so no NPM proxy host, no portal card and no URL:
an operator could not reach it at all.

v2:

- A second container, `hermes-dashboard`, runs `hermes dashboard` — the
  dashboard's real launch path. It shares the Hermes home volume
  (`/opt/data`) with the gateway container; upstream supports running
  the gateway and dashboard side by side.
- `HERMES_DASHBOARD_PORT` now defaults to `9119` (the dashboard is on by
  default) and the dead `HERMES_DASHBOARD*` env block is removed.
- A new `HERMES_SUBDOMAIN` variable (default `hermes`) gives the
  dashboard an internal-exposure NPM proxy host behind Authelia
  forward-auth — which in turn yields a portal card and a URL.

Operator impact: after redeploy the dashboard is reachable at
`https://hermes.<PUBLIC_DOMAIN>` (LAN-only, SSO-gated) and appears on the
ServiceBay portal. No data migration is needed — the dashboard reads the
same Hermes home the gateway already uses.
