# solilos-chat

A small, stateless, offline-capable household chat proxy. Serves a static
chat page and forwards turns to Hermes' **native session API**. Replaces
the fragile in-process `hermes-webui` (#139).

## Design

- **Stateless** — holds no chat/session store. The browser keeps the
  current session id; all chat/session/memory state lives in Hermes
  (`~/.hermes`). No duplication, no ambiguity about where data is.
- **Offline** — page → this proxy → Hermes API
  (`127.0.0.1:{{HERMES_API_PORT}}`/8642) → local Ollama. No external hop;
  the page bundles its own CSS/JS (no CDNs).
- **Not fragile** — own tiny image, no foreign `:latest`, no in-process
  agent.

## SSO (folds in #134)

Behind Authelia forward-auth, NPM sets `Remote-User` after the user
authenticates. This proxy reads that header and folds it into the Hermes
`uid` — no second login. The bearer token (`API_SERVER_KEY`) is held
server-side and never reaches the browser. The pod binds loopback, so only
NPM (which sets the header after Authelia) can reach it.

Absent header (e.g. direct loopback access for offline testing) falls back
to `DEFAULT_UID`.

## Hermes contract

- `GET /api/sessions?user_id={uid}` — list the uid's sessions.
- `POST /api/sessions` — create a session bound to the uid.
- `GET /api/sessions/{id}` — get a session + its message history.
- `POST /api/sessions/{id}/chat` — body `{"input": …}`. For an image turn,
  `input` is an OpenAI content-parts array (a `text` part + one `image_url`
  part per `data:image/…;base64,…` URL) — the only shape Hermes session-chat
  consumes. Returns the reply.

(Not the gatekeeper's placeholder `/converse`, which does not exist in the
real Hermes API.)

## Multimodal input

The composer has a microphone button (browser-local speech-to-text via the
Web Speech API — the transcript pre-populates the message box) and an
attachment button (upload or in-browser camera capture via
`getUserMedia`, with a client-side crop). Attached images are sent to the
proxy as `data:image/…;base64,…` URLs under the chat body's `images` key; the
proxy folds them into Hermes' `input` as OpenAI `image_url` content parts so a
vision model can act on them (an image with no typed text gets a default
prompt so the turn still goes through). For the local Ollama model to receive
the pixels natively, solbay's post-deploy sets `model.supports_vision: true`
in Hermes' `config.yaml` — otherwise Hermes' `image_input_mode: auto` falls
back to a vision tool that needs a separate provider and the model stays
blind to the attachment. Mic/camera need a secure context (HTTPS or
localhost) and degrade gracefully when the browser lacks support.

Hermes does not retain inbound images (it persists a `[screenshot]`
placeholder and exposes no attachment API), so the proxy keeps the sent data
URLs in a small per-session store under `ATTACHMENTS_DIR` and re-attaches them
on history load — the one stateful exception, so thumbnails survive a refresh.

## Per-user privacy

Every session is created with `user_id: uid` (the SSO identity). The proxy
scopes both the list and single-session fetch to the caller's uid — it
passes `user_id` to Hermes **and** re-filters by each session's own
`user_id`, so a resident sees only their own sessions and cannot open
another resident's session by guessing its id (returns 404).

## Environment

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CHAT_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Loopback bind for NPM. |
| `CHAT_PORT` | `8787` | Host loopback port. |
| `HERMES_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8642` | Hermes native API base. |
| `API_SERVER_KEY` | — | Bearer for Hermes; server-side only. |
| `REMOTE_USER_HEADER` | `Remote-User` | Authelia identity header → uid. |
| `DEFAULT_UID` | `household` | uid when the header is absent. |

## Endpoints

- `GET /` — the chat page.
- `GET /health` — `{"ok": true}`.
- `GET /api/sessions` — `{"ok": true, "sessions": [{id, title, last_activity}]}`
  (the caller's own sessions only).
- `POST /api/sessions` — `{"ok": true, "session_id": …}` (new session for the uid).
- `GET /api/sessions/{id}` — `{"ok": true, "session": {id, title, last_activity, messages}}`
  or `404` if it isn't the caller's session.
- `POST /api/chat` — `{"input": …, "session_id": …?}` →
  `{"ok": true, "session_id": …, "reply": …}`.
- `POST /api/chat/cancel` — `{"session_id": …}` → interrupts that session's
  in-flight stream (the panel's Stop button); the stream closes its upstream
  Hermes connection, ending the model run, and emits a `cancelled` frame.
- `POST /api/mcp/{server}/test` — admin-only; `{"tool": …, "arguments": {…}}`
  invokes one MCP tool via the sidecar (the Tools-panel tester) →
  `{"ok": true, "result": …}` or `{"ok": false, "error": …}`.

## Run

```
pip install -e .
HERMES_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8642 API_SERVER_KEY=… python -m solilos_chat
```
