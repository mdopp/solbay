"""Immutable per-resident uid marker embedded in Hermes session titles (#153).

Hermes v0.16.0 does not persist the `user_id` we POST on session create (it
stores `user_id: null`), so the proxy cannot scope sessions by resident at the
database level. Instead each session title carries a sentinel prefix
`[uid:<8-char-hash>] ` minted from a hash of the caller's uid; the proxy filters
the session list/history to titles bearing the *caller's* marker and strips the
marker before the title reaches the browser.

The marker is browser-immutable by omission: the chat proxy router exposes only
GET/POST/DELETE on sessions (no PATCH/rename route), so a browser client has no
way to rewrite a title and strip the marker. The only title-write path is the
proxy's own `set_title`, which always re-injects the prefix. Do NOT add a PATCH
route — that would create a browser-reachable strip path.

Hashing (not the raw uid) keeps usernames out of the persisted title. 8 hex
chars + `[uid:] ` = 15 chars; with the human title capped well under Hermes'
100-char limit there is ample headroom.
