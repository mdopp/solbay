"""Shipped personality catalog.

Hermes 0.15.1 has no personalities API and the session chat endpoint does
not interpret `/personality` slash commands (they arrive as plain user
text). What it *does* accept is a `system_prompt` on session **create**
(PATCH rejects it), so a personality here is a named overlay prompt the
proxy attaches when a session is born. The overlay rides on top of the one
global SOUL.md — it shapes tone/structure, it does not replace the soul.

Selection is per-session and open to every resident (no admin gate): the
browser picks an id on a new session and the proxy maps it to the prompt.
`sol` is the default and carries no overlay (pure SOUL.md).
