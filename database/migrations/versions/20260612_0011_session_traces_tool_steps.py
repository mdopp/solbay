"""add step_kind + tool_name to session_traces

Revision ID: 0011_session_traces_tool_steps
Revises: 0010_engine_cron_runs
Create Date: 2026-06-12

A turn's trace is now the full interleaved step list — LLM calls AND tool
executions (#346). `step_kind` distinguishes them ('llm'|'tool'); `tool_name`
carries the dispatched tool for a tool step (NULL for an LLM step). Both
nullable so pre-existing rows stay valid; a read treats a missing `step_kind`
as the legacy 'llm'.
