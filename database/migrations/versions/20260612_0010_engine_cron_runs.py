"""add engine_cron_runs — durable last-run stamps for the engine night jobs

Revision ID: 0010_engine_cron_runs
Revises: 0009_engine_sessions
Create Date: 2026-06-12

Phase 3 of the Sol Engine: the night jobs (daily-chronicle,
problem-summarizer, chat-compactor) move from Hermes' jobs.json onto the
engine scheduler. Jobs are defined in code (idempotent by construction —
the Hermes-era upgrade de-dup problem from #332 can't recur); this table
only remembers each job's last fired slot so a restart inside the same
cron minute doesn't double-run it.
