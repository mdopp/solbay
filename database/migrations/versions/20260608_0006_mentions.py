"""add inline mentions table for #tag / @person

Revision ID: 0006_mentions
Revises: 0005_session_topics
Create Date: 2026-06-08

Inline mentions (#279, solilos-architecture.md §3 "Mention-based tagging"): the
`#tag` / `@person` tokens typed in a chat replace the retired Thema picker. Each
mention is keyed by `session_id` + a per-session message reference
(`message_ref`, the user-turn ordinal that carried it — drives jump-to-message)
+ `kind` ('tag'|'person') + `value` (the tag/person string), scoped per-resident
by `owner_uid` (D3, like topics/session_topics). The PK keeps the same
(value, kind) from being recorded twice for the same message.
