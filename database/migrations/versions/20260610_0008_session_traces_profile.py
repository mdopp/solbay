"""add profile column to session_traces

Revision ID: 0008_session_traces_profile
Revises: 0007_session_traces
Create Date: 2026-06-10

Tag each persisted LLM step with the Hermes profile that produced it. The trace
proxy reads the `Active Hermes profile: <name>.` line Hermes injects into the
system prompt, so the steps panel can show whether a turn was served by the
household or admin profile (was previously ambiguous). Nullable — pre-existing
rows and older-Hermes calls (no profile line) stay NULL.
