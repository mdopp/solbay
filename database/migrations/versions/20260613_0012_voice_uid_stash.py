"""add voice_uid_stash table

Revision ID: 0012_voice_uid_stash
Revises: 0011_session_traces_tool_steps
Create Date: 2026-06-13

The transcript-keyed uid side-channel for the live HA Assist path (#350,
approach b). When the gatekeeper serves as HA's Wyoming STT provider it
resolves the speaking resident (ECAPA + k-NN) and stashes
`{transcript -> uid}` here; the engine facade looks the uid up by the
incoming utterance text when HA calls `conversation.sol` for the same turn.
Consume-once + short TTL so a stale uid never leaks into a later turn.
